## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- OLCE-MA's chaotic exploitation is a greedy local search again instead of an
  unconditional random kick. Every offspring was displaced in every dimension,
  every iteration, with no acceptance test and no decay — and because the
  logistic map at `r = 4` has an arcsine stationary distribution concentrated
  near 0 and 1, the typical displacement was near-maximal rather than
  near-zero. The stage now generates one chaotic neighbor per elite male, with
  a radius that decays linearly to zero over the run, and accepts it only when
  it is not worse. On 10-dimensional Rastrigin over 30 seeds (500 iterations,
  default population) the mean best cost of `NewOLCEConfig` improves from
  8.4392 to 2.8035; the standard algorithm scores 3.6211 on the same seeds, so
  OLCE-MA was previously more than twice as bad as the variant it enhances.
- OLCE-MA's orthogonal learning no longer spends its evaluation budget when
  `OrthogonalFactor` is 0. Both the blend and the perturbation scale with the
  factor, so all four L4 candidates were bit-identical to the parent male and
  the stage was a guaranteed no-op that still cost four evaluations per elite
  male per iteration — 8000 of 38540 evaluations (20.8%) in the run above.
  `ApplyOrthogonalLearning`, `ApplyOrthogonalLearningToElite` and the pooled
  path now return immediately for a non-positive factor.

### Changed

- **Behaviour change for `UseOLCE` runs.** Chaotic exploitation moved off the
  crossover and mutation offspring and onto the elite males, so an OLCE-MA run
  no longer reproduces a result recorded under v0.5.0. `ChaosFactor` keeps its
  default of 0.1 but now means the *initial* radius of a decaying neighborhood
  rather than a constant displacement; setting it to 0 disables the stage.
  The stage costs one evaluation per elite male per iteration.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- The crossover offspring count now tracks the population. `NC` was an absolute
  `20` that no caller had reason to revisit, so raising `NPop` bought a larger
  swarm and not one additional crossover. At `NPop` 4096 the same ten pairs
  mated while 4086 members only followed the global best, which quietly reduced
  the algorithm to plain PSO — and, because every variant configuration derives
  from `NewDefaultConfig`, did so for DESMA, OLCE-MA, EOBBMA, MPMA, GSASMA and
  AOBLMOA alike. Any comparison between variants run at a raised population was
  therefore measuring a handicapped algorithm.

### Added

- `NCAuto`, the default value of `NC`, deriving the offspring count from `NPop`
  and the new `NCRatio` (default 1.0, giving `NC == NPop`). A written `NC` still
  wins, including the `0` that disables crossover, so no field a caller sets is
  silently replaced.
- `Selection` with `SelectionRank` and `SelectionTournament`, plus
  `TournamentSize`, making parent selection configurable rather than hardcoded.
  `SelectionRank` remains the default and the historical behaviour.

### Changed

- **Breaking for callers that raised `NPop`.** A run at any population other
  than the default 20 now performs a different number of crossovers and will
  not reproduce a result recorded under v0.4.0. Set `config.NC = 20` to restore
  the old count exactly. At the default `NPop` of 20, `NCAuto` resolves to 20
  and results are unchanged.
- `validateOffspring` judges the resolved offspring count rather than the
  written `NC`, and rejects an unknown `Selection`, a negative `NCRatio`, and a
  negative `TournamentSize`.

### Notes

- `SelectionTournament` is implemented and configurable but is **not** the
  default: at `NPop` 20 it reduced Griewank 10D success from above 70% to 60%
  (Standard MA) and 20% (DESMA) on this repository's regression suite. Once
  `NC` scales, rank pairing mates the fitter half of the population at every
  size, so the elitism it appeared to cause was the `NC` bug rather than the
  pairing rule.


## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Structured optimization lifecycle logging compatible with `log/slog`.
- CSV and JSON convergence-curve export on optimization results.
- Optional bounded parallel evaluation across the core optimizer, genetic
  operators, and all algorithm-specific enhancement phases.
- Parallel multi-algorithm comparison with statistical aggregation and result
  visualization utilities.
- Target-cost, stagnation, and adaptive-iteration convergence controls.
- Inequality and equality constraints with feasibility-rule and penalty-based
  candidate ranking.

### Changed

- Added compile-checked package examples, an API quick reference, and a
  complete configuration field index.
- Documented when parallel evaluation offsets its scheduling overhead.
- Expanded race, determinism, evaluation-accounting, convergence, and
  constraint-handling tests.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Context cancellation, progress observation, and caller-provided initial
  populations for optimization runs.
- Explicit termination reasons and run-lifecycle documentation.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Updated CI and lint configuration for reliable race and coverage runs.
- Stabilized seeded integration scenarios.
- Restored package documentation and resolved static-analysis findings.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-30

### Changed

- Renamed `Result.BestSolution` to `Result.ConvergenceCurve` to reflect that
  the field contains per-iteration costs. This is a breaking API change.

### Fixed

- Validate offspring count `NC` before optimization, preventing out-of-range
  access for incompatible population and offspring sizes.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-21

### Added

- Initial implementation of seven Mayfly Algorithm variants.
- Benchmark functions, algorithm selection, comparison utilities, examples,
  JSON configuration, and algorithm documentation.
