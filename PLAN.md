# Mayfly Algorithm Suite - Remaining Tasks

## High Priority

### Phase 1: Advanced Features

#### 1.1 Parallel Fitness Evaluation (Core)

- [ ] Implement worker pool for bounded concurrency
- [ ] Parallelize male population fitness evaluation
- [ ] Parallelize female population fitness evaluation
- [ ] Thread-safe global best update mechanism (mutex/atomic)
- [ ] Configuration: `Config.MaxWorkers` (default: runtime.NumCPU())
- [ ] Configuration: `Config.EnableParallel` flag for backward compatibility
- [ ] Benchmarks comparing sequential vs parallel performance

**Rationale**: For expensive objective functions (simulations, ML training), this provides 10-20x speedup on multi-core systems. Core populations have 20+ individuals evaluated per iteration.

#### 1.2 Parallel Genetic Operators

- [ ] Parallel crossover offspring evaluation
- [ ] Parallel mutation offspring evaluation
- [ ] Thread-safe offspring slice management
- [ ] Race detector tests (`go test -race`)

**Rationale**: Offspring generation (NC + NM individuals) happens every iteration. Parallelization reduces iteration time significantly.

#### 1.3 Parallel Variant-Specific Enhancements

- [ ] DESMA: Parallel elite candidate generation and evaluation
- [ ] OLCE-MA: Parallel orthogonal learning candidate evaluation (4 per elite)
- [ ] EOBBMA: Parallel opposition point evaluation
- [ ] GSASMA: Parallel Golden Sine candidate evaluation
- [ ] AOBLMOA: Parallel Aquila strategy evaluation
- [ ] MPMA: Thread-safe median position calculation

**Rationale**: Variant-specific operations add significant computational overhead. OLCE generates 4 candidates per elite (top 20%), DESMA generates 5+ elite candidates. These are natural parallelization targets.

#### 1.4 Multi-Algorithm Parallel Comparison Framework

- [ ] Concurrent execution of multiple algorithms on same problem
- [ ] Enhanced comparison example using goroutines
- [ ] Statistical comparison utilities with parallel runs
- [ ] Results aggregation and visualization

**Rationale**: Users often want to compare MA, DESMA, OLCE-MA, EOBBMA, GSASMA, MPMA, AOBLMOA on same problem. Running 7 algorithms sequentially takes 7x time; parallel execution is much faster.

#### 1.5 Parallel Infrastructure Testing & Validation

- [ ] Comprehensive race condition tests
- [ ] Verify deterministic results with same seed (challenging with parallel execution)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks showing speedup vs core count
- [ ] Validate no fitness evaluations are lost or duplicated
- [ ] Test with cheap vs expensive objective functions
- [ ] Document when parallel execution is beneficial vs overhead

**Rationale**: Parallel execution introduces complexity (race conditions, non-determinism). Thorough testing is critical to ensure correctness and measure actual performance gains.

**Phase 1 Total Effort Estimate**: Items 1.1-1.5 represent ~5-8x the original single "Parallel Execution" item. This is a major feature requiring careful design for thread-safety across all 7 algorithm variants.

#### 1.6 Convergence Detection

- [ ] Early stopping criteria
- [ ] Stagnation detection
- [ ] Adaptive iteration limits

#### 1.7 Constraint Handling

- [ ] Penalty function methods
- [ ] Feasibility rules
- [ ] Constraint-handling utilities

### Phase 2: Release Preparation

#### 2.1 Code Quality

- [ ] Run golangci-lint and fix issues
- [ ] Verify 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization

#### 2.2 Release

- [ ] Setup semantic versioning
- [ ] Create CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Publish to pkg.go.dev
